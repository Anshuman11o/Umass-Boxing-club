As a Web Developer for the UMass Boxing Club, I helped in revamping the club's website to enhance usability, improve interactivity, and streamline event management. 
I developed a modern, responsive interface using React, TypeScript, and Node.js, ensuring better organization and navigation for users. 
Additionally, I worked closely with club leadership to incorporate feedback and optimize the website's functionality, ultimately improving membership engagement and event promotion efficiency.
